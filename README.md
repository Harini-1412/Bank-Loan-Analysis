**Bank Loan Analysis**

**Overview :**
The Bank Loan Report Project is designed to provide comprehensive insights into the bank's lending activities and performance. The goal of this project is to develop dashboards that monitor key loan-related metrics, analyze trends, and assist in making data-driven decisions. The report will cover various aspects of the loan portfolio, including total applications, funded amounts, received amounts, interest rates, debt-to-income ratios, and the classification of loans as 'Good' or 'Bad.' Additionally, it will provide detailed visualizations and a consolidated view of loan data to enable a deep understanding of the bank's lending operations.
